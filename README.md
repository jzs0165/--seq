**Pseudo-seq**

Pseudouridine (Ψ) is an isomer of the nucleoside uridine, which is regarded as the most abundant RNA modification.**Pseudo-seq** is one of the method recently developed to detect pseudouridine modification on RNAs. In this mothed, the RNAs are treated with **CMCT**(1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate). Under mild alkaline hydrolysis, the Ψ-CMC adducts will be kepted in the RNA strand, which can lead to RT stop. Combined with next generation sequencing, we can figure out the potential Ψ sites. This script is generated to calculate the Ψ peak found in the KSHV lncRNA PAN, using a set of 10 biotinylated ssDNA probes with CMC treatment and Illumina sequencing.
